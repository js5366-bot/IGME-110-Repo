| [Marvel Spider-Man](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvels-spider-man/)   | Amazing story and open world, got 100% in two days |
| Hogwarts Legacy     | Huge fan of harry potter so I loved  this game, great open world and a fun story | 
| Stardew Valley      | Played this with mods most of the time, a very relaxing game to pass the time with | 
| Dispatch            | Really fun and unique game, loved the different story outcomes. Spared shroud both play throughs | 
| Red Dead Redemption 2 | First really big open world game I completed, loved the western setting and the emotional story | 
| Before Your Eyes | The most I have cried while playing a game, changed how I veiw the world and how I spend my time | 
| Project Zomboid | Painfully realistic zombie survival that took many tutorials to finally understand but extreamly worth it |

| **Multiplayer Games** | **These  are the best games I have played with friends.** | 
| Call of Duty Black Ops II | A classic game, constantly play it with my brother and best friends when we are all together (Best Zombies) |
| The Finals | A great shooter game, love the demilition in it and the varity of playstyles available, | 
| Minecraft | Another classic, I have spend a decent percentage of my life playing this game, I love exploring |
| GTA 5 Online | Can be kind of grindy some times, but when played with the right people can be the most fun game to mess around in | 
| STAR WARS Battlefront II | RIP, can't believe they quit working on this game. If it wasn't so bad on launch it would have been a goldmine for them. | 
| Garry's Mod | This game had every single thing you could think of, spent hours mindlessly running around with random assests. | 
| Sea of Thieves | I love this game until a group of 12 year olds sink our ship and steal all of our loot 10/10 |
 | Lethal Company | Woke my parents up many nights because of my screams, very fun to play would reccomend with friends. |
