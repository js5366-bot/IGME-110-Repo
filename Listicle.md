| [Marvel Spider-Man](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvels-spider-man/)   | Amazing story and open world, got 100% in two days |
| Hogwarts Legacy     | Huge fan of harry potter so I loved  this game, great open world and a fun story | 
| Stardew Valley      | Played this with mods most of the time, a very relaxing game to pass the time with | 
| Dispatch            | Really fun and unique game, loved the different story outcomes. Spared shroud both play throughs | 
| Red Dead Redemption 2 | First really big open world game I completed, loved the western setting and the emotional story | 
| Before Your Eyes | The most I have cried while playing a game, changed how I veiw the world and how I spend my time | 
| Project Zomboid | Painfully realistic zombie survival that took many tutorials to finally understand but extreamly worth it |

| **Multiplayer Games** | **These  are the best games I have played with friends.** | 
| ---- | ------------- |
| Call of Duty: Black Ops II | A classic game, constantly play it with my brother and best friends when we are all together (best Zombies). |
| The Finals | A great shooter game — love the demolition and the variety of playstyles available. |
| Minecraft | Another classic; I have spent a decent percentage of my life playing this game. I love exploring. |
| GTA 5 Online | Can be kind of grindy sometimes, but with the right people it’s the most fun game to mess around in. |
| Star Wars Battlefront II | RIP. Can’t believe they quit working on this game — if it wasn’t so bad at launch it would’ve been a goldmine. |
| Garry’s Mod | This game had everything you could think of; spent hours mindlessly running around with random assets. |
| Sea of Thieves | I love this game until a group of 12-year-olds sink our ship and steal all our loot — 10/10. |
| Lethal Company | Woke my parents up many nights because of my screams — very fun to play, would recommend with friends. |
